Acknowledgement:
I am a student of CSE department .I am very happy by completing this project. This is myfirst project of my university life. So I tried to take a uncommon and important project. My “TYPING GAME” was appreciated by project teacher. My
Project teacherMd. SazzadHossain(Assistant ProfessorDept. of CSE) was very much helpful to complete the project approximately. He always encouragesdeveloping this kind of project. The department of CSE has a contribution in software development because all teachers and studentshave an eagerness to engage themselves in software development. I took a many help from my course teacher about the project. He dedicated his valuable time to make the topics easy which were difficult to understand by the student. As a result I feel comport to complete the project by my own creativity.
